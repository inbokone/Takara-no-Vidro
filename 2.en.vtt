WEBVTT

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Senior, I'm sorry for making you wait.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
How was it?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The doctor says it got a lot better.
I'm fine now.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Thank you for coming with me.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
No big deal. Plus the club president
kept pestering me.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Look, Takara. You have to take care
of Nakano-kun until his ankle's healed.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Why me?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Don't argue.
This is the president's order.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Damn it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It can't be helped.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Not like that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Eh?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll let you hang onto my arm
until we reach the ropeway.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You don't need to.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can hop with one leg to get there.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You can't do that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Let's go.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm glad it's better.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Because I want to go hiking again.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Don't force yourself.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If you get hurt again, I won't help you.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Come on. Let's go.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I never thought I'd be walking
with the person from back then.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You know your way home, right?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Uh, yes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I have to make a stop.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Bye.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
A general store?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He's laughing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
He's capable of making that face.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 2)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I haven't seen Akira lately.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Is he doing well?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Yeah.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yeah?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Here. Thanks for coming.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
- Mm.
- Mm.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Who's that? Someone you know?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
That guy.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
What are you looking at?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Uh, I'm sorry.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I got a little curious.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You like fashion accessories?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You seem to like them more.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Not exactly.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But I thought I'd look better with them.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Look better?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I didn't want you to think

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I was lame when I finally found you.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I don't like those flashy earrings.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Eh?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But someone like you...

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Those would suit you.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Those are...

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
diamonds?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
They're glass.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Wow.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Glass can be so beautiful.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Would they suit me?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Your eyes...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
My eyes?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
No.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Nothing.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You can leave.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Hold on.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
From now on, can I...

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
talk to you on campus?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I guess so.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Thank you.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So I'll see you on campus.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
That's not the way to your place.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Eh?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You live here?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Yes.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Is that a good idea?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Eh? Did something horrible happen here?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
That's the problem.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
A klutz like you should live
in a place with auto locks.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I changed schools at the last minute
so there weren't good places left.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Oh, but it's clean inside.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You wanna come in for tea?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Don't be too trusting.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Eh?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Because someone who seems kind
might not really be kind.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I'm off.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Watch your step)

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yesterday Senior said something
I didn't quite understand.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Ow.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Does your leg hurt?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
But it's almost healed.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Come on.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Take a seat.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Thank you very much.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
A university student?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Yes. I just started.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
That's nice. Experiencing new things.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They gave me extra pork.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Congrats.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Tai-chan! Tai-chan!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Tai-chan. Over here. Over here.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Tai-chan?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You mean me?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yes. Tai-chan is short for Taishin.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Sit here. Let's eat together.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
- Come on, sit down.
- Mm.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Please.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Please take a seat.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Tai-chan, did you pick a club?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
- Think I'm gonna join the hiking club.
- Yeah?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Oh, a handsome senior's in that club.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Is it Senior Takara?
The freshies are talking about him.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Is that so?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But have you heard the rumor?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
What rumor?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They say last year's Miss Nakaba
has her eye set on Senior Takara.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Eh?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So he's really popular.
Because he's gorgeous.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Oh. Is that so?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Is Senior around here?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
- Senior...
- Takara-kun.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
What are you doing?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Uh...

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They say last year's Miss Nakaba
has her eye set on Senior Takara.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
They looked perfect for each other.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Maybe...

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
he bought it for her.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Hey.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Oh, Nakano-kun.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
How's your ankle?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It's getting better.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Plus, Senior Takara
has been taking care of me.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Taken care of by Senior Takara.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I'm so jealous.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
There we go again.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Maybe it's his good karma.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Good karma?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Are you here to see Takara?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Sorry, some girl called him away.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I didn't know that. Was she Miss Nakaba?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Who knows.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I'm jealous he gets hit on
by someone that pretty.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Will Senior Takara reciprocate?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Please don't. I'm in shock.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Hey, don't tell me
you have your eye on that girl.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
No.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I never dated anyone

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
so I don't really
understand these things.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
That's so noble.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Noble?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
- Ignore her.
- What do you mean by that?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Or is that considered strange?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
These things are subjective.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Just go at your own pace.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Is he going to...

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
date her?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Why wouldn't you date me?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
You're single right now.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I think I'm good enough for you.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
- So...
- You...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
must see me as an object.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I can't stand that kind of person.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Cruel.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
No wonder you've always been alone.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Uh, Senior...

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
That was the first time
I saw him making that face.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Tai-chan, you're more
distracted than usual.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
You can say what's bothering you.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Actually...

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
a senior who helped me in the past
doesn't look very happy,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
so I want to do something for him.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But I have no idea what to do.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Mm.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Maybe give him a present.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Like a snack. Does he eat sweets?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I have no idea.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I don't know anything about him.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Is there something he likes?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Something he likes...

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Hey, Takara.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Did you really say no to her?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
You're being annoying.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
What a shame.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Why won't you date anyone?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
My reason...

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
doesn't matter.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Welcome.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Oh, you're the kid hovering over
the window when Takara were here.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Hovering?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Are you Takara's friend?
But you don't look it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I'm not his friend.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But I'm his junior.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Really? That's weird.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
He has a soft spot for younger ones.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
A soft spot?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What brings you here today?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I pick my own products,
so there are all kinds of stuff.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Well...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
What did Senior Takara
buy the other day?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The other day?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Oh! There were custom-made items.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Do you mind telling me what they were?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Eh?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
When he bought them,
he was laughing with happiness.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So I thought if I buy them for him,
he might feel better.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
What? Does that guy look sad?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Yes.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
That's why I'd like you to tell me.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I see. I'll make an exception for you.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Marbles?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Yes, Takara likes glassware.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I don't know why,
but he seems to love marbles.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I see.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
He's a kid at heart
despite his appearance.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
He's collecting them.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I'd like to buy them.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
That was quick.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I'll wrap them for you.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
He can be difficult,
but deep down he's a good guy.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Yes.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
These earrings.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Oh, those things. Pretty, aren't they?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Do you like them?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
- Try them on.
- I can?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Mm. Use the mirror there.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Wow.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Eh?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Perfect. They're perfect for you.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
You have an attractive face.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Sometimes plain jewelry is enough.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Attractive?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Has no one ever told you
your eyes are very beautiful?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
They're shiny like glass.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
- Oh, don't stare at me.
- I can't?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It's not that.
It just feels like I'm being pulled in.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Will he like them?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
We meet again.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
- Thank you for the other day.
- No need.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I'm glad you remember.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Doing some shopping today?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yes.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I bought a present

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and these.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I see. They look very good on you.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Hey.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Senior.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Are you joining our club?
The president pestered me to ask you.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Uh...

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Yes.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Oh, right.
I have to submit an application.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Give me your phone.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
It's our club's group chat.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
There'll be a welcoming party.
Say hi in there.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I'm off.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Uh, Senior.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
What?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I want to give you something.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Eh?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Did I forget them?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Huh?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
You're going straight home?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Yes.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I'm going that way anyway.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I'll stop by your place.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Here.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
For you.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
What is it?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
You've helped me with many things.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And I came across
that incident the other day.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I don't know how to explain it.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
But I wanted you to smile.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
That blabbermouth.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I asked him to tell me.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Because you looked so happy
when you looked at marbles.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I might not know anything about you.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
But I wanted to cheer you up.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Besides...

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
you're not alone, Senior.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I wanted you to know that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Looks like the sky's in there, right?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Eh?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I had so much fun looking at them
when I was a kid.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So it became a habit.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Thanks.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
You can have one.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Thank you.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Oh.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I finally bought them.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Do I look creepy wearing them?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Mm.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I thought so. I'm sorry.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I've gotten to know him
a little better now.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
(Next episode)
Something he finds interesting?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Despite his appearance, he's attentive.
Keep on keeping on.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Doesn't matter if they're men or women.
Just pick someone you can trust.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Are you okay, Senior?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
The messages you've been
sending were super lame.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Lame?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I'll be right there.
