WEBVTT

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:13.240
You can have one.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:17.240
Thank you.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.500
I ended up accepting it from him.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.660
I'm Nakano Taishin.

00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:54.955
Freshman.

00:00:56.418 --> 00:01:02.640
Please be kind.

00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:08.133
(I'm Nakano Taishin.
Freshman. Please be kind.)

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:09.452
(Please be kind.)

00:01:10.164 --> 00:01:11.164
(bowing)

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:13.301
Whoa.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.633
Everyone replies so quickly.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.580
We meet again.

00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:32.352
The guy from the other day.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:34.706
Did your ankle heal?

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:38.011
Yes, I'm fine now.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:39.863
Glad to hear that.

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:43.390
What a kind man.

00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:48.447
Eh?

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:50.267
Hm?

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.930
It came off.

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:52.962
Eh?

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:55.142
Ah.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.187
If you don't mind...

00:01:58.953 --> 00:01:59.953
please use this.

00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:03.014
Thanks.

00:02:04.383 --> 00:02:06.526
You're such a good kid.

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:16.333
(Takara: Please be kind.)

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:06.279
"Takara's Treasure"
(Episode 3)

00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:14.357
We managed to shed a lot of freshmen
who had their eyes on you.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.969
Anyway, Nakano is the kid who talked
to you at the orientation, right?

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.987
He joined our club.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.121
(Taishin)

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.218
All right, consider it accepted.

00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:32.769
Sorry for the late submission.

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:35.851
It's okay because
we haven't gotten many applications.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:45.829
The jackets you guys wore.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:46.892
Hm?

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:49.948
Where can I buy one?

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:57.020
Because I wanna have
hiking clothes and gear.

00:03:57.045 --> 00:04:00.060
Well, in this area...

00:04:02.724 --> 00:04:06.876
This shop also sells hiking gear.
Try there.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:09.723
Wait.

00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:12.833
- This shop.
- Eh? You know it?

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:22.241
Oh.

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:26.237
Oh, you're Takara's junior.

00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:29.249
Well, why are you here?

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:30.869
Uh...

00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:35.876
I wanted hiking gear and the club
president recommended this shop.

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:56.611
I can't tell which type works best.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.389
What are you looking for?

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:04.984
I have no idea what to buy.

00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:08.988
The other day on the hike,
you were wearing a jacket, right?

00:05:09.404 --> 00:05:10.519
Yes.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.247
What about t-shirts?

00:05:12.532 --> 00:05:13.532
Do you own any?

00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:15.176
Eh?

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.340
Quick dry ones.

00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:19.471
No.

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:24.453
It's gonna be warm soon.
You have to own one.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.096
Wow, this is surprising.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.499
Takara acting like a senior.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.591
Quit watching and take
care of the customers.

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:38.238
His senior's already taking care of him.

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:39.824
Shut up.

00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:41.777
And stop slacking off.

00:05:41.802 --> 00:05:42.802
Yes, sir.

00:05:57.348 --> 00:06:00.050
Thank you for helping me pick.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:01.075
Mm.

00:06:02.287 --> 00:06:04.114
I gotta go to my part-time job.

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:07.185
Wait.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.561
If I'm in trouble,

00:06:13.404 --> 00:06:16.076
do you mind if I contact you?

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:17.943
What trouble?

00:06:21.742 --> 00:06:23.200
No idea.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.080
I won't take ridiculous calls.

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:34.848
Despite his appearance,
he's attentive. Keep trying.

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:36.367
Yes.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.210
Here.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.346
Thank you.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.748
We meet again.

00:06:49.878 --> 00:06:50.878
Oh.

00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:53.363
What a coincidence.

00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:54.803
Today...

00:06:55.678 --> 00:06:57.315
you're out shopping again?

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.419
Yes.

00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:01.789
I was with my senior just now.

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:03.128
Is that so?

00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:05.127
That sounds fun.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:14.997
Is that so?

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:17.450
It's good you thanked him.

00:07:19.453 --> 00:07:23.126
I made a few friends.
And I joined a club.

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.054
And I got to talking with the shop owner

00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:29.167
and an uncle I met on a bus.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.583
That's good, honey.

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:36.255
But there aren't only
good people out there. Be careful.

00:07:36.466 --> 00:07:38.738
I know that.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.141
But listen to me.

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:44.038
The messages you've been
sending were super lame.

00:07:44.218 --> 00:07:46.025
Eh? Lame?

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:49.266
Instead of photos of mountains
and trees we already have here,

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:51.438
send photos that represent
the capital city.

00:07:54.137 --> 00:07:56.460
Represent the capital city?

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.903
Like what?

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:00.361
Eh?

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:05.066
Like Naka-Meguro where celebrities live.

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:10.820
Naka-Meguro?

00:08:14.732 --> 00:08:17.863
Hey, what's with the message
you just sent me?

00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:18.888
Eh?

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:21.106
Don't send me weird stuff during class.

00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:22.358
What did you send?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160
This.

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.372
- What's this?
- Eh?

00:08:28.397 --> 00:08:30.744
I sent a message as an uncle for fun.

00:08:30.825 --> 00:08:34.994
It's super creepy.
You should focus on the class.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:36.019
Well.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.964
- You're not one for small talk, Mei.
- Mm.

00:08:39.082 --> 00:08:41.198
You always use "Copy that" stickers.

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.270
There wasn't a topic to discuss.

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:47.092
Topics don't just happen naturally.

00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:49.818
We have to create them.

00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:52.303
She says with such pride.

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:57.237
There are a lot of things
the other person finds interesting.

00:08:57.872 --> 00:08:59.949
That's because you're hyperactive.

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:01.725
Right?

00:09:02.128 --> 00:09:03.128
Eh?

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.700
Mm.

00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:12.900
Things the other person
finds interesting?

00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:24.761
You always eat that.
Aren't you sick of it?

00:09:25.258 --> 00:09:26.404
Not at all.

00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:29.239
- You also got your usual.
- Eh?

00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:32.938
- I feel I'm getting famous.
- For what?

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:34.018
Ramen.

00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:46.060
Skateboards.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:50.667
(Best Hiking Spots Around the Country)

00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:52.334
Mountains.

00:09:52.974 --> 00:09:54.540
Coffee.

00:10:25.571 --> 00:10:29.028
(Taishin: I'm in. Please be kind.)

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.231
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:35.525
Little bro, heading home already?

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.850
Come drink with us.

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.670
Don't you have things to do?

00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:41.448
You're always working.
You never go out with us.

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:42.473
He's right.

00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:45.673
All right, I hear you. I'll go.

00:10:47.741 --> 00:10:48.741
Get off me.

00:10:48.974 --> 00:10:50.149
What's wrong with this?

00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:13.747
Such beautiful blossoms.

00:11:19.217 --> 00:11:22.959
Should I send this to him?

00:11:24.107 --> 00:11:25.213
Wait.

00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:27.185
But it's lame, isn't it?

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:33.937
We meet again.

00:11:35.685 --> 00:11:37.278
Haven't had dinner, have you?

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:40.573
You must feel dismayed
living in Tokyo by yourself.

00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:43.970
I just bought you grilled chicken.

00:11:44.249 --> 00:11:47.386
If you don't mind,
can I go to your apartment?

00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:48.996
Eh?

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:54.886
I don't think so.

00:11:55.687 --> 00:11:56.687
Uh...

00:11:58.436 --> 00:11:59.761
I'm gonna go.

00:12:37.367 --> 00:12:38.367
Eh?

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.126
What's wrong?

00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:42.175
Are you okay?

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.716
Come on.
Let's have grilled chicken together.

00:12:48.964 --> 00:12:49.964
Please.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.710
Hey!

00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:05.037
I wanna be popular.

00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:08.397
What do I have to do to be popular?

00:13:08.408 --> 00:13:11.521
Move to a country
filled with popular people.

00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:13.172
I can't afford that!

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.820
Hey, Takara, any suggestions?

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:17.670
Keep trying.

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:19.610
Hey, don't just say that.

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:24.271
Don't you have a cheaper way
for me to get popular, teacher?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.992
(Nakano Taishin)
Mm, let's see.

00:13:28.883 --> 00:13:31.810
Maybe move to Turkey? I heard
the Japanese find them attractive.

00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:34.222
Wait, why do I have to
move to another country?

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:36.314
- Will that work? Who would do it?
- Why not?

00:13:36.325 --> 00:13:37.325
What's up?

00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:42.312
Hey, can you hear me?

00:13:43.191 --> 00:13:45.718
Oh, uh, senior.

00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:49.413
Well, right now...

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:51.716
there's this uncle...

00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:53.773
Huh?

00:13:54.704 --> 00:13:56.982
There's this uncle...

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.896
asking to come in my apartment.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:03.296
He's been standing outside.

00:14:03.966 --> 00:14:04.966
For real?

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.146
Is he dangerous?

00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:09.202
No.

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:12.409
He's not dangerous per se.

00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:18.234
But I'm...

00:14:19.105 --> 00:14:20.105
afraid.

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:24.897
- Gotta go.
- Hey!

00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:28.189
Was that a girl, sir?
Did a girl call you, Takara-san?

00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:29.535
Was that a girl, sir?!

00:14:33.392 --> 00:14:34.630
I'm on my way.

00:14:35.144 --> 00:14:36.634
Don't open the door.

00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:39.398
I'll be right there.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.430
Hang in there.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:45.419
I will.

00:15:12.158 --> 00:15:13.463
What's wrong?

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.265
The chicken will go cold.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.535
Well...

00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:52.243
You finally answered.

00:15:54.863 --> 00:15:56.044
Well...

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:02.066
You showing up at my place like this...

00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:05.207
To be honest...

00:16:06.355 --> 00:16:08.890
it makes me uncomfortable.

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.108
Eh?

00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:11.554
Why?

00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:17.620
You were willing to open up to me.

00:16:18.528 --> 00:16:21.068
And you gave me that kind of smile.

00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:24.701
It'll be okay.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.838
Open the door for me, please.

00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:43.745
Uncle.

00:16:47.698 --> 00:16:48.786
Why are you here?

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:50.888
Well.

00:16:51.146 --> 00:16:53.647
I was just asking him
to have dinner with me.

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.058
Put yourself in his shoes.

00:16:56.786 --> 00:16:58.701
The guy in there is afraid of you.

00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:01.246
Eh?

00:17:01.345 --> 00:17:02.745
If you keep this up,

00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:04.611
I'll call the police.

00:17:05.969 --> 00:17:07.805
That wasn't my intention.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.555
You find me that disgusting?

00:17:20.827 --> 00:17:22.030
Is that true?

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.327
I'm sorry.

00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:49.402
You can open the door.

00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:06.914
Hey.

00:18:08.276 --> 00:18:09.369
Are you okay?

00:18:13.082 --> 00:18:14.770
You must have been terrified.

00:18:16.901 --> 00:18:18.241
Let's get inside.

00:18:31.887 --> 00:18:33.117
Senior...

00:18:33.722 --> 00:18:36.198
You stink of booze.

00:18:38.938 --> 00:18:40.790
Is that the first thing you say to me?

00:18:42.636 --> 00:18:44.851
You're lucky I was drinking nearby.

00:18:47.872 --> 00:18:49.171
I'm sorry.

00:18:51.154 --> 00:18:52.643
The next thing I knew,

00:18:53.447 --> 00:18:55.094
I was already calling you.

00:19:00.164 --> 00:19:02.060
Do you know that uncle?

00:19:04.008 --> 00:19:05.008
Uh...

00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:08.158
Lately,

00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:12.441
we've been running into each other
on the bus or a sidewalk.

00:19:13.699 --> 00:19:16.092
So we started talking.

00:19:18.507 --> 00:19:20.965
He's a classic stalker.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.079
He's been targeting you.

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:33.311
And if I were anything like him,
I would've already taken care of you.

00:19:38.374 --> 00:19:39.611
But I'm...

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.559
a man.

00:19:43.178 --> 00:19:45.660
Some men find other men attractive.

00:19:48.107 --> 00:19:49.976
Is that so?

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.862
Some would misunderstand you
even when you've done nothing wrong.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:01.566
Doesn't matter if they're men or women.
Just pick someone you can trust.

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:09.603
So...

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.612
I can pick you?

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.580
Don't know.

00:20:27.653 --> 00:20:30.070
Just don't talk to strangers.

00:20:31.936 --> 00:20:33.415
Well, I was...

00:20:34.954 --> 00:20:37.853
happy he praised me about my earrings.

00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:38.947
Huh?

00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:41.193
You're so gullible.

00:20:41.218 --> 00:20:42.218
Eh?

00:20:55.764 --> 00:20:56.867
Senior!

00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:01.474
Well...

00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:06.296
Thank you very much for yesterday.

00:21:07.253 --> 00:21:08.253
Mm.

00:21:09.178 --> 00:21:13.518
I was hesitant about what I
should talk about with you over text,

00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:17.191
but I ended up starting out
by calling you about yesterday.

00:21:18.148 --> 00:21:19.928
If yesterday didn't happen,

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.351
what would you have sent me?

00:21:28.379 --> 00:21:30.840
I wanted to send you this.

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:32.972
A pot marigold?

00:21:33.658 --> 00:21:36.678
You really are a senior. You're awesome.

00:21:37.614 --> 00:21:38.823
Are you insulting me?

00:21:39.379 --> 00:21:40.379
Eh?

00:21:46.143 --> 00:21:47.407
At the time...

00:21:48.665 --> 00:21:52.558
I was so terrified I couldn't think.

00:21:55.371 --> 00:21:59.411
The next thing I knew,
I was already calling him.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.225
If it's this stuff,

00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:06.170
I can send it to you?

00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:07.469
You're a pest.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:10.325
Eh? So what am I allowed to send you?

00:22:11.126 --> 00:22:12.151
Don't know.

00:22:12.376 --> 00:22:13.464
Eh?

00:22:14.057 --> 00:22:16.462
The person I thought of...

00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:21.203
wasn't anyone else, but only him.

00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:18.409
(Next episode)
I might be fanboying for him right now.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.000
When did our relationship
turn into that?

00:23:22.082 --> 00:23:25.981
So what is this I'm feeling, senior?

00:23:29.043 --> 00:23:31.003
It might not be a laughing matter.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:31.958
Eh?

00:23:31.969 --> 00:23:36.220
The sorrow from losing one's idol
cannot be healed.

00:23:36.365 --> 00:23:37.365
Are you free?

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:38.800
Eh?
